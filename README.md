This is the place where I learn how to write codes.

This project aims to use CCI to forecast the overbuy and oversell situations for those most liquid currency Pairs

# Logics
CCI is deemed to fluctruate between 100 and -100. There are rare cases in which the CCI moves beyond these boundaries. Hence the periods in which abs(CCI)>100 are considered to be intermittent.

# My research
Based on my research during my 2-month research project during 2012 summer, the croston's method is the most straight forward and best strategy to forecast a intermittent pattern.
